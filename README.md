# 2D 4 Materials Heat Transfer Analysis
Gas Dynamics and Heat Transfer project which seeks to emulate the temperature evolution in a 2D plate with four materials in it.

One can read the [Report](.info/Report_2D4Mat.pdf) to see the entire physical and computational analysis of the procedure, as well as the main code in the [Annex](.info/Annex_2D4Mat.pdf). Here is attached the resulting field of temperature given a certain example case.
